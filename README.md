# Datacamp-Projects
This respository stores all the R-based coding projects from DataCamp.com that I have wrangled so far. Each of these projects required skills like data wrangling, visualizing, and data analysis. 

Feel free to download the code or suggest an edit. If you have figured out a better way to write the same code, please drop in a line. I am eager to improve.

Happy coding!
